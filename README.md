# UCAN DOIT!
### User Controlled Authorization Network Digital Online Interactive Terminal

## What is this?

UCAN DOIT is a visual terminal for creating UCANs, delegating capabilities between actors (using UCANs) and invoking UCANs against remote services.

At the moment it has some idiosyncricies unique to the `w3up` service and uses a 
pre-specification implementation of UCAN invocation. Patches with support for 
other UCAN-based services are welcome.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using UCANs!
